Title: Bird community responses to climate change and forest management in a red pine plot at Itasca State Park.

We used a combination of meta-analysis and primary data to analyze the 
response of 54 species of male breeding birds to climate and management changes 
through time in a red pine plot at Itasca State Park. Breeding bird census
data was collected in approximately the same location spanning from an initial survey in 1980, 
four surveys during the 1990s, and most recently in 2018. We were 
able to quantify breeding bird responses in this plot to changes in the local 
climate and forest management actions. Sampling grids were established Bird counts were conducted on 68 (1980) or 55 (1990-2018) gridpoints for 
approximately 10 minutes at each survey point. Bird point counts were then repeated five 
to eight times per growing seasons in years 1980, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1997, and 2018. We also measured 
habitat data such as tree diameters and species, woody shrub stem counts, and understory and overstory 
cover, and we collected historic climate data from the Weather Service. We found that XX% of bird 
species surveyed increased in abundance, XX% decreased in abundance, and XX% did not change through time.

12.75 Ha in Mills Paper, 10 in all other surveys.
