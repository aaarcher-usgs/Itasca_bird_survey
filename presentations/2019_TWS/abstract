Title: Bird community responses to climate change and forest management in a red pine plot at Itasca State Park.

We used a combination of meta-analysis and primary data to analyze the 
response of 54 total species of male breeding birds to climate and management changes 
through time in a red pine plot at Itasca State Park. Using breeding bird census
data in the same location spanning from initial surveys in 19XX to 2018, we were 
able to determine how breeding birds responded in this plot to changes in the local 
climate and forest management actions. Bird point counts were conducted on XX gridded survey 
points for XX minutes at each survey point. Bird point counts were then repeated twice per growing seasons 
in years XX, XX, XXX.... We also measured habitat data such as tree diameters and species, woody shrub stem counts, 
and understory and overstory cover, and we collected historic climate data from the Weather Service. 
We found that XX% of bird species surveyed
increased in abundance, XX% decreased in abundance, and XX% did not change through time.

Thoughts:

Breann: Background of Red Pine Plot. This is the same piece of land studied in previous years.
I think one of the most important things to point out is we are at almost the same exact spot as the 1979/1980 census
