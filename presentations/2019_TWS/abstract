Title: Bird community responses to climate change and forest management in a red pine plot at Itasca State Park.

We used a combination of meta-analysis and primary data to analyze the 
response of 54 species of male breeding birds to climate and management changes 
through time in a red pine (Pinus palustris) plot at Itasca State Park. Breeding bird census
data was collected in approximately the same location spanning from an initial survey in 1980, 
four surveys during the 1990s, and most recently in 2018. We were 
able to quantify breeding bird responses to changes in the local 
climate and forest management actions. Bird counts were 
conducted on 68 (1980) or 55 (1990-2018) gridpoints for 
approximately 10 minutes at each survey point. Bird point counts were then repeated five 
to eight times per growing seasons in years 1980, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1997, and 2018. We also measured 
habitat data such as tree diameter and species, woody shrub stem counts, and understory and overstory 
cover, and collected historic climate data from the Weather Service. We found that 
10 surveyed bird species (18.5%) increased in abundance, 1 (1.9%) decreased in abundance, 
and 43 (79.6%) did not change through time. The Black-throated Green Warbler, which breeds in 
mature conifer forests in Minnesota, declined in abundance, whereas species such as Red-eyed Vireo and
Chestnut-sided Warbler increased in abundance. This may be related to the decline of 
the mature red pines in this forest and the shrubby understory encroachment as this plot succeeds from 
planted coniferous to mixed hardwood forest.
