Bird community responses to climate change and forest management in a red pine plot at Itasca State Park.

Background of Red Pine Plot. This is the same piece of land studied in previous years.
I think one of the most important things to point out is we are at almost the same exact spot as the 1979/1980 census

We used a combination of meta-analysis and primary data to analyze the 
response of XX species of male breeding birds to climate and management changes 
through time in a red pine plot at Itasca State Park. Using breeding bird census
data from 19XX to 2018, we were able to determine that XX% of bird species surveyed
increased in abundance, XX% decreased in abundance, and XX% did not change through time.
